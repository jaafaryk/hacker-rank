Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers
of float data type as input and output their sum:

- Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.
- Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given
in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.
- Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:
Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one
decimal place on a new line.

Input Format:
The first line contains two integers.
The second line contains two floating point numbers.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ integer variables ≤ 10 
- 1 ≤ float variables ≤ 10

Output Format:
Print the sum and difference of both integers separated by a space
on the first line, and the sum and difference of both float (scaled
to 1 decimal place) separated by a space on the second line.
